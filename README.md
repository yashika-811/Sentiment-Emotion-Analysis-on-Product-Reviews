# Sentiment-Emotion-Analysis-on-Product-Reviews
This project performs Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Detection on product reviews similar to platforms like Amazon and Flipkart. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the system classifies customer reviews into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments and detects emotions such as Joy, Anger, Sadness, and Fear.  


## Objectives

* Analyze customer reviews using NLP
* Classify sentiments using polarity scores
* Detect emotions using a lexicon-based approach
* Visualize sentiment and emotion distribution
* Generate insights from large-scale textual data

---

##  Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – Data handling
* **NLTK** – Text preprocessing
* **TextBlob** – Sentiment analysis
* **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
* **Regex (re)** – Text cleaning

---

##  Project Workflow

1. Load customer review dataset
2. Clean text (lowercasing, removing stopwords & symbols)
3. Perform sentiment classification
4. Detect emotions using keyword matching
5. Save analyzed results
6. Visualize sentiment & emotion distribution
7. Generate insights
